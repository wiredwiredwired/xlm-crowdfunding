# STELLAR CROWDFUNDING DAPP - DEPLOYMENT SCRIPT
#
# This script automates the build and deployment process for the Stellar
# crowdfunding decentralized application (DApp). It compiles the Soroban
# smart contract to WebAssembly (WASM) and provides deployment instructions.
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Rust toolchain with wasm32-unknown-unknown target
# - Soroban CLI tools
# - Cargo package manager
#
# Usage: ./deploy.sh
